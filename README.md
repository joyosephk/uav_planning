Plan evaluator for the UAV Scenario 1

#### Prerequisites

You need to have [VAL validator](http://github.com/KCL-Planning/VAL) installed.  Put this in your system PATH so that the command `validate` executes.  You also need to have PDDL domain and problem files in the directory, but these are already included in the repo.  

#### Running

```
python evaluateplan.py
```

This reads from "sampleplan_raw" plan file and outputs plan validity and metrics like number of resolved tasks and total fuel usage onto the terminal. 

For fun, you can "sampleplan_processed" plan file that is auto generated by the script.  This is in standard PDDL format.
